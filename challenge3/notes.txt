start by making a enviroment file for your variables and put these variables in
{image}

the ones specified as "db" are for the api itself as where the "sql" ones are for the database variables themselves
{image}

whatever you name as your "host" variable will need to be set as the same thing as the service for the database in the docker-compose file later

these variables will be used when creating a new database connection

now create the docker-compose file
{image}

in here we will add the services for the api, nginx, and the database.
{image}

we can see that every build will connect to the folder for the same services under the context section
{image}

we will set the ports and now most importantly under the database and the api we will have "env_file" linking to the the variables.env file
{image}

this is what we will use to be able to grab the important variables for the API and the database connection

now we can start the instance and create the containers with "docker-compose up --build"

this will create all the containers and using the compose file run through each instance of their dockerfiles.

for the database it will make a temp environment to create the table with the entry point and for nginx create the new config to reroute the address

now you have everything running and able to display these outputs
{images}

when typing "docker-compose ps" this is the result
{image}
